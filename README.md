# electron-image-resizer
It is a desktop application built using Electron.
The main purpose of the app is to resize image files.
Users can upload an image, specify a width and height, and the app will create a resized version of the image.
The resized image is saved to a folder in the user's home directory called "imageresizer."
The core resizing functionality uses the resize-img library.
The interface is styled with Tailwind CSS and provides a simple UI for uploading images and specifying dimensions.
There is an About page describing it as "FileResizer App" (version 1.0.0, MIT License).
In summary, this repo provides a cross-platform desktop utility for resizing images through a user-friendly graphical interface.
